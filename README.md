## Additional Features
- We added additional menu options:
    - CAMERA PRESET BONUS: We defined three preset locations for the camera, which can be cycled through by pressing C. Preset locations: Topdown view, Player View, Starting Position View
    - HIDE GUI: We added options to hide the GUI by pressing H
    - GAME DEV DIAGNOSTICS: We added extra info to help us as developers, such as displaying the current camera position and orientation onto the screen for debugging purposes. Can display by pressing backtick (`) or tilde (~)
- We decided to create the Boston Celtics home court since they are objectively the best team in the world, which means we have the best court. Again, this is all objective fact.
- The colors around the field match the team's color, and the logo is printed onto the center circle of the field.

## Extra Textures
- We used only two external textures: 
    - A logo of the Boston Celtics taken from [here](https://worldvectorlogo.com/logo/boston-celtics-1)
    - A generic basketball texture: [link](https://opengameart.org/content/basket-ball-texture)
